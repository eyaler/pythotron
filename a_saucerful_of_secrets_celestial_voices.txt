General notes:
-- Chords are based on what Wright is playing on the organ with his right hand,
   as seen and heard in the (pitch-correct) video: https://youtu.be/UwVj-ifpyyc?t=316
   Following the intro, the chord inversions are determined by Water's bass (mostly root inversion).
   However, to recreate the voicings played by Wright (as far as I could determine them) on top of that bass,
   we use the implementations: 1-3-5-8 (root + 1st inversion) for E, F#, G and 1-5-8-10 (root + 2nd inversion) for D, Em

-- You can press f to toggle the slider up solo exclusive "one-finger" mode where any up-moving slider will be soloed exclusively
-- You can transpose by some semitones up or down by an even number of presses on the TRACK-REW/FF or DOWN/UP keyboard arrows
-- You can press CYCLE to lock the knobs from accidental pitch bending, or alternatively use the knobs for some sweet vibrato
-- You can record (REC) and loop (PLAY) the passage, allowing you also to play over with the sampler (MARKER-REW or -)
